Given an integer with no more than 9 digits, you are supposed to read it in the traditional Chinese way. Output `Fu` first if it is negative. For example, -123456789 is read as `Fu yi Yi er Qian san Bai si Shi wu Wan liu Qian qi Bai ba Shi jiu`. Note: zero (`ling`) must be handled correctly according to the Chinese tradition. For example, 100800 is `yi Shi Wan ling ba Bai`.
