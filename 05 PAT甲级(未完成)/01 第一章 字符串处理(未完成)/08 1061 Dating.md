#简单 #模拟 #字符串 

Sherlock Holmes received[^1] a note with some strange strings: `Let's date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm`. It took him only a minute to figure[^2] out[^3] that those strange strings are actually[^4] referring[^5] to the coded time `Thursday 14:04` -- since the first common[^6] capital[^7] English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter `D`, representing[^8] the 4th day in a week; the second common character[^9] is the 5th capital letter `E`, representing the 14th hour (hence[^10] the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from `A` to `N`, respectively[^11]); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is `s` at the 4th position[^12], representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode[^13] the dating time.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format `DAY HH:MM`, where `DAY` is a 3-character abbreviation[^14] for the days in a week -- that is, `MON` for Monday, `TUE` for Tuesday, `WED` for Wednesday, `THU` for Thursday, `FRI` for Friday, `SAT` for Saturday, and `SUN` for Sunday. It is guaranteed that the result[^15] is unique[^16] for each case.

### Sample Input:

```in
3485djDkxh4hhGE 
2984akDfkkkkggEdsb 
s&hgsfdk 
d&Hyscvnm
```

### Sample Output:

```out
THU 14:04
```

### Idea

1. 注意逻辑判断关系

### AC code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

string s1, s2, s3, s4;
string week[] = {"MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT", "SUN"};

int main(void){

    cin >> s1 >> s2 >> s3 >> s4;

    int i = 0;
    while(true){
        if(s1[i] == s2[i] && s1[i] >= 'A' && s2[i] <= 'G') break;
        i++;
    }
    cout << week[s1[i++] - 'A'];

    while(true){
        if(s1[i] == s2[i] && (s1[i] >= '0' && s1[i] <= '9' || s1[i] >= 'A' && s1[i] <= 'N')) break;
        i++;
    }
    printf(" %02d", s1[i] <= '9' ? s1[i] - '0' : s1[i] - 'A' + 10);

    for(int i = 0; ; i++){
        if(s3[i] == s4[i] && (s3[i] >= 'a' && s3[i] <= 'z' || s3[i] >= 'A' && s3[i] <= 'Z')){
            printf(":%02d\n", i);
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
