Given any positive integer $N$, you are supposed to find all of its prime factors, and write them in the format $N = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times  \dots  \times p_m^{k_m}$.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer $N$ in the range of **long int**.

### Output Specification:

Factor $N$ in the format $N = p_1$ `^` $k_1$ `*` $p_2$ `^` $k_2$ `*` $\dots$ `*` $p_m$ `^` $k_m$, where $p_i$'s are prime factors of $N$ in increasing order, and the exponent $k_i$ is the number of $p_i$ -- hence when there is only one $p_i, k_i$ is 1 and must **NOT** be printed out.

### Sample Input:

```in
97532468
```

### Sample Output:

```out
97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291
```

### Idea



### AC code

```cpp
```
