When register on a social network, you are always asked to specify your hobbies in order to find some potential friends with the same hobbies. A **social cluster** is a set of people who have some of their hobbies in common. You are supposed to find all the clusters.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains a positive integer $N ( \leq 1000)$, the total number of people in a social network. Hence the people are numbered from 1 to $N$. Then $N$ lines follow, each gives the hobby list of a person in the format:

$K_i~:~h_i[1]~h_i[2]~\dots~h_i[K_i]$

where $K_i (>0)$ is the number of hobbies, and $h_i[j]$ is the index of the $j$-th hobby, which is an integer in [1, 1000].

### Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line the total number of clusters in the network. Then in the second line, print the numbers of people in the clusters in non-increasing order. The numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

```in

1: 4
2: 5 3
1: 4
